## Inspiration

The ASCII-art-plus-auto-updating-stats idea was shamelessly stolen from [Andrew Grant's](https://github.com/Andrew6rant) profile.

For the code, I opted to sacrifice performance for readability and maintainability, and used the [`PyGithub`](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) library.

## ASCII Art

To create the art displayed in the `README.md`, I used [Zoraiz Hassan's](https://github.com/TheZoraiz) [`ascii-image-converter`](https://github.com/TheZoraiz/ascii-image-converter) with the `--braille` and `--dither` flags, and refined the result manually.
